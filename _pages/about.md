Hello! I am a physics student and aspiring scientist currently attending the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in experimental particle physics, with particular focus in computational techniques and data analysis. My current work is in the development of efficient algorithms for reconstructing charged particle trajectories in high energy experiments.
