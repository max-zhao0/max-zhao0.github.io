Research
======
**University of California, Berkeley**
_Department of Physics
Undergraduate Researcher, June 2022 - Present
Supervisor: Heather Gray_
* Development of a novel machine learning based algorithm for charged particle tracking with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
* Implemented and showed efficacy on simulated muon tracks in a 9 layer telescope detector.
* Developed custom data structures and training data pipelines for implementation in the TrackML detector’s dense hit environment.
* Trained and benchmarked neural network components of the algorithm on large simulated datasets

**Space Sciences Laboratory, Berkeley, CA**
_Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON)
Undergraduate Research Apprentice, September 2021 - May 2022
Supervisor: Thomas Immel_
* Data analysis for ICON’s onboard Far Ultraviolet spectrometer which measured column integrated atomic oxygen to nitrogen ratio (O/N2) in the Ionosphere.
* Generated a comparable O/N2 dataset using low level data from the TIEGCM-ICON computational model.
* Showed seasonal deviation in predicted O/N2 in the southern hemisphere.
