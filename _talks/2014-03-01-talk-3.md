Given at the poster session for recipients of the Berkeley MPS Summer Research Funding, open to a general audience.

**Abstract:**
\
In high energy experiments, track reconstruction is the computational problem of reconstructing charged particle trajectories from hits left in a detector. As accelerators are upgraded, the integration of machine
learning techniques into track reconstruction algorithms is an active research
area. We would would like an algorithm that preserves the track following structure of the Combinatorial Kalman Filter in conjunction with neural net-
work components. To that end, we are developing a track reconstruction algorithm based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which has found success in parsing similarly intractable search spaces. This summer we have developed and trained the neural network components for an implementation on the TrackML detector, which would allow us to benchmark performance
against existing algorithms.
